  file: add_realloc.patch
  description: |
    Blink overrides ArrayBuffer's allocator with its own one, while Node simply
    uses malloc and free, so we need to use v8's allocator in Node. As part of the
    10.6.0 upgrade, we needed to make SerializerDelegate accept an allocator
    argument in its constructor, and override ReallocateBufferMemory and
    FreeBufferMemory to use the allocator. We cannot simply allocate and then memcpy
    when we override ReallocateBufferMemory, so we therefore need to implement
    Realloc on the v8 side.
