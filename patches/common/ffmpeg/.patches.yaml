    Chromium's Mac toolchain sets the "install_name" linker parameter only
    when "is_component_build" is true, but we want to set even if it's false,
    because we are making a dylib which will be distributed inside a bundle.

    Builds on Linux x86 fail with a clang error. See https://crbug.com/796379.
    Once it's fixed the patch can be removed.
